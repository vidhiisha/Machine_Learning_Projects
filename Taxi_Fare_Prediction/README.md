# üöñ Predict Amount of Taxi  

A machine learning project that predicts taxi fare amounts based on trip details, including pickup/dropoff coordinates, timestamps, and passenger count. This project demonstrates **end-to-end data science workflow** with data cleaning, feature engineering, multi-model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## üîç Multi-Model Training and Comparison for Taxi Fare Prediction  

This project evaluates and compares multiple regression models to identify the most accurate model for predicting taxi fares:  

- **Linear Regression**  
- **Decision Tree Regressor**  
- **Random Forest Regressor**  
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**  

The best-performing model is selected based on **R¬≤ score, MAE, and RMSE** metrics.
